# Python Scripts

Python scripts that I've developed or found useful

## Working with IP Addresses

### ipconv.py

This script will convert IP lists from or to CIDR notation, IP ranges, or individual IPs in a list

### ipdiff.py

This script will take two lists of IPs and output one of the following:

1. All IPs from both lists
2. Overlapping IPs (IPs in both lists) 
3. Unique IPs in either the first or second list
